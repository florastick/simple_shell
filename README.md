# ALX Simple Shell Team Project

This is an ALX collaboration project on Shell. We were tasked to create a simple shell that mimics the Bash shell.

Our shell shall be called hsh.

## DESCRIPTION 

This repository is a ALX Holberton School Project. The school project consisted in writing a shell like sh (Bourne Shell) by Stephen Bourne , in C, using a limited number of standard library functions, so instead we used our own function that we rewrited over the past three month Here.
